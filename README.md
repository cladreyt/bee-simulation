# Bee Pollination Simulation

This project models an agent-based simulation of bees pollinating flowers.  
The bees in the simulation are categorized as either scouts or foragers, each with specific behaviors aimed at optimizing the collection and return of pollen to the hive.  
The simulation environment is a grid with flower clusters, and the goal is to observe and analyze the behavior and efficiency of bees in pollen collection.

## Features
- Simulates bee foraging and scouting behaviors.
- Bees navigate a grid environment with flower clusters.
- Scouts find flower locations and recruit foragers.
- Foragers collect pollen and return to the hive.
- Visualizes the beesâ€™ movements and pollen collection over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- pylab

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cladreyt/bee-simulation.git
$ cd bee-simulation
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the simulation by executing the script:
```bash
python bee_simulation.py
```
